"""``pass-cli`` binary discovery + lazy install.

Hermes pins one ``pass-cli`` version (:data:`_PASS_CLI_VERSION`) and downloads
the matching asset from the official Proton download path, verifying the
SHA-256 against a HARDCODED pinned table (:data:`_PINNED_SHA256`).  Because the
version is pinned, the asset digests are constants — there is no runtime
manifest fetch, no recursive JSON walk, and no "scan for the version" logic.

Bumping pass-cli: update :data:`_PASS_CLI_VERSION` AND :data:`_PINNED_SHA256`
together (pull the new digests from
``https://proton.me/download/pass-cli/versions.json``), in the same PR.

    Resolution order (security-aware):
      1. ``<hermes_home>/bin/pass-cli``  (our managed copy) — preferred, but
         NEVER trusted blindly.  We re-verify it by SHA-256 WITHOUT EXECUTING
         it (exec bit + a hash match against the pinned digest on raw-asset
         platforms, or against the install-time sidecar digest on the Windows
         zip platform) before returning it.  We deliberately do NOT run
         ``--version`` on a managed copy: executing an unverified binary is the
         very hijack we are defending against (a tampered managed copy could run
         as the user and read ``~/.hermes/.env`` before any hash check).  On
         mismatch we reinstall (when ``install_if_missing``) or warn + skip — we
         never hand the token to an unverified managed binary just because the
         path exists.
      2. When ``install_if_missing`` is True and the managed copy is
         absent/invalid, INSTALL the verified pinned binary BEFORE falling back
         to a PATH binary.  Installing a known-good, checksum-verified binary is
         safer than running whatever ``pass-cli`` happens to be first on
         ``PATH`` (a PATH-hijack would otherwise be handed the service token).
      3. ``shutil.which("pass-cli")``    (system PATH) — used only as a last
         resort, and only after CRYPTOGRAPHICALLY verifying it.  A PATH binary
         is handed the service token ONLY when its SHA-256 matches a pinned
         asset digest (genuine pinned bytes, regardless of where they live).
         A version-only gate is NOT sufficient here: a malicious PATH ``pass-cli``
